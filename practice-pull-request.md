## shell

We learned about the shell. A unix or linux shell is a text-based interface
that allows you to interact with the files on a system as well as use software.
In the shell you can use commands like cd, mkdir, and ls to explore and interact
with the directories and files.
You can also use software. For example you could use the nano software to
open and edit a readme file with the command nano README.md 

## Git

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes
made to a codebase. It can be used solo or with a team.
A git repository tracks and saves the changes made to all files
in the repository. If something goes wrong you can revert back to
an older version of the codebase.
A codebase can be saved with in a remote repository and local repositories.
Edits can be made on a local repository and then pushed to the remote repository.

## GitHub
GitHub is a hosting service where remote Git repositories can be saved.
With GitHub you can created additional branches off of the main branch
of a repository. Those additional branches can be dedicated to new features
that a contributor is working on.
When you want to add the completed feature to the main codebase,
you can create a pull request so that other collaborators are notified
to review the code before it is merged with the main branch.
